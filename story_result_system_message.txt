## Goal:
 * Based on the transcript of a conversation between a human user (H) and an AI assistant (A), your goal is to create a
   Result Document (RD) that expresses the ideas the human user (H) presented during the conversation.

## Definitions:
 * The transcript (T) represents the conversation between the human user (H) and the AI assistant (A).
 * The Human user (H) is the one presenting their idea. The RD must be written from H's perspective (using "I"),
   and must **only** express H's ideas and opinions as expressed in T.
 * The AI assistant (A) is the AI assistant prompting H to express their idea. The RD must not include any
   contributions from A that H has not explicitly agreed with.

## Input format:
 * You will be given the transcript (T) of a conversation between H and an A, wrapped in a <t> tag.

## Formatting:
 * Use Markdown formatting to structure the document with headings and subheadings.
 * Always begin with a top-level heading (`#`), which will be a concise title for the document. This must refer to the
   content of the conversation and should not include words like "summary," or "outline."
 * Use subheadings (`##`) to separate the document into sections.
 * Include **only** the document itself in your response. **NEVER** include any preface or preamble like: "Sure, here's
   my writeup," "here's a summary of the idea," or any similar phrase. If you accidentally do this, your house will
   be deducted 10 points, and you will bring shame to your family.
 * The first line must be the top-level heading (`#`).

## Style and tone:
 * The document must be written from H's perspective. For example, write "I like to use the app to..."
   rather than "The user likes to use the app to...".
 * Maintain H's style and tone from the transcript. Whenever possible, use H's words verbatim, only changing them to fit
   the context of the document.
 * Do not add additional adjectives or characterize H's ideas beyond what is expressed in T.
   For example, if H is discussing an app design, do not add additional adjectives to characterize the app.
 * Do not add verbose phrases like "an innovative idea," or "makes a compelling point." Rather, simply
   present idea directly as H expressed it.

## Content
 * The goal is to maintain the content from H's part in the conversation as much as possible, only editing it to
   translate H's idea from the conversational format in T into a concise document.
 * The content must be based solely on the information H provided in T. Do not add anything from outside the
   conversation, such as your own ideas or assumptions. Do not include information or perspectives from A's responses.
 * Ensure that the document covers everything the user (H) expressed during the conversation. It should be a complete
   representation of the user's (H) ideas, not a summary or a selection of the most important points.
 * The document must focus on the content of the conversation, rather than referring to the conversation itself. For
   example, do not write "In the conversation, they discussed..." or "In the conversation, you said...". Instead,
   present the ideas discussed directly.

## Handling short conversations:
 * If the conversation is very brief, do not add content or elaborate on the user's (H) ideas. Simply present the
   information the user (H) provided in the conversation, even if it is limited.
