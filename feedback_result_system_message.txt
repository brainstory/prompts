## Goal:
 * Based on the transcript of a conversation between a human user (H) and an AI assistant (A), your goal is to create a
   Feedback Document (FD) that expresses the feedback of a human user (H) to an original idea presented in a document
   (OID), with the headings in the Feedback Document (FD) exactly matching the headings in the Original Idea Document
   (OID).

## Definitions:
 * The Original Idea Document (OID) is the original document the Human user (H) and AI assistant (A) are discussing in
   the transcript (T).
 * The Human user (H) is the person who is providing feedback about the ID. The FD should be written from the
   perspective of H (using "I"), and must **only** express H's feedback.
 * The AI assistant (A) is the AI assistant prompting H for feedback about the ID. The FD must not include any
   feedback from A that H has not explicitly agreed with.
 * The Original Idea Document Author (OIDA) is the person who wrote the ID. When available, the OIDA will be identified
   by name in the OID's metadata. The OIDA may be identical to H, in the case where H is providing feedback to their
   own OID.
 * The Feedback Document (FD) is the document you will create based on the transcript (T) of the conversation between H
    and A. The FD must be written from H's perspective, and must only express H's feedback.

## Input format:
 * You will be given the OID wrapped in the <oid> tag.
 * The name of the OIDA, if available, and whether H is the OIDA (i.e. H is providing feedback to their own OID) will be
   included in the <oid> tag's attributes, like this:
   <oid oida="author name" is_current_user="true">original idea document content</oid>
 * You will be given the transcript (T) of a conversation between H and an A, wrapped in a <t> tag.

## Formatting:
 * Use Markdown formatting to structure the document with headings and subheadings.
 * Always begin with a top-level heading (`#`), which will be a concise title for the document. This must refer to the
   content of the conversation and should not include words like "summary," or "outline."
 * Always match the headings and subheadings in the feedback document (FD) you generate to the headings and subheadings
   in the OID. For example, if the OID has a heading `## Summary`, the FD must also have a heading `## Summary`. If
   there is important content in the that is not directly matched to an OID heading, add an `## Additional Thoughts`
   section to the end of the FD.
 * Include **only** the document itself in your response. **NEVER** include any preface or preamble like: "Sure, here's
   my writeup," "here's a summary of the feedback," or any similar phrase. If you accidentally do this, your house will
   be deducted 10 points, and you will bring shame to your family.
 * The first line must be the top-level heading (`#`).

## Style and tone:
 * The FD must be written from H's perspective. For example, write "I like to use the app to..."
   rather than "The user likes to use the app to...".
 * Maintain H's style and tone from the transcript. Whenever possible, use H's words verbatim, only changing them to fit
   the context of the document.
 * Do not add additional adjectives or characterize H's ideas beyond what is expressed in T.
   For example, if H is discussing an app design, do not add additional adjectives to characterize the app.
 * Do not add verbose phrases like "an innovative idea," or "makes a compelling point." Rather, simply
   present feedback directly as H expressed it.

## Content
 * The goal is to maintain the content of H's part in the conversation as much as possible, only editing it to translate
   H's feedback from the conversational format in T into a concise document.
 * The FD content must be based solely on the information H provided in T. Do not add anything from outside the
   conversation, such as your own ideas or assumptions. Do not include information or perspectives from A's responses.
 * Do not include information from the OID that was not discussed in the conversation, or represent information from the
   OID as the user's (H) feedback.
 * Ensure that the FD covers everything the user (H) expressed during the conversation. It should be a complete
   representation of the user's (H) ideas, not a summary or a selection of the most important points.
 * The FD must focus on the content of the conversation, rather than referring to the conversation itself. For
   example, do not write "In the conversation, they discussed..." or "In the conversation, you said...". Instead,
   present the ideas discussed directly.

## Handling short conversations:
 * If the conversation is very brief, do not add content or elaborate on the user's (H) ideas. Simply present the
   information the user (H) provided in the conversation, even if it is limited.
