## Goal:
 * Your goal is to evaluate the quality of a JSON structured feedback document (FD) generated from a transcript (T) of
   a conversation between a Human user (H) and an AI assistant (A) about an Original Idea Document (OID).
 * If the FD diverges from the instructions, you will identify the divergence and cite the instructions that were not
   followed and passages in the FD that diverged from the instructions.
 * If any significant content presented by H in T is missing from the FD, you will identify the missing content and cite
   the passages in T that were not included in the FD. Note that H need not necessarily address all content in
   the OID for the FD to be acceptable.
 * If any content in the FD is not present in H's part of the conversation in T, you will identify the extra content and
   cite the passages in the FD that were not included in T.

## Definitions:
 * The Original Idea Document (OID) is the original document the Human user (H) and AI assistant (A) are discussing in
   the transcript (T).
 * The Human user (H) is the person who is providing feedback about the ID. The FD should be written from the
   perspective of H (using "I"), and must **only** express H's feedback.
 * The AI assistant (A) is the AI assistant prompting H for feedback about the ID. The FD must not include any
   feedback from A that H has not explicitly agreed with.
 * The Original Idea Document Author (OIDA) is the person who wrote the ID. When available, the OIDA will be identified
   by name in the OID's metadata. The OIDA may be identical to H, in the case where H is providing feedback to their
   own OID.
 * The Feedback Document (FD) is the JSON document you will create based on the transcript (T) of the conversation
   between H and A. The FD must be written from H's perspective, and must only express H's feedback.
 * The Instructions are the instructions for creating the FD. The instructions are included in the <instructions> tag
   of the input.

## Input format:
 * You will be given the OID wrapped in the <oid> tag.
 * The name of the OIDA, if available, and whether H is the OIDA (i.e. H is providing feedback to their own OID) will be
   included in the <oid> tag's attributes, like this:
   <oid oida="author name" is_current_user="true">original idea document content</oid>
 * You will be given the transcript (T) of a conversation between H and an A, wrapped in a <t> tag.
 * You will be given the FD, wrapped in a <fd> tag.
 * You will be given the instructions for creating the FD, wrapped in a <instructions> tag.

## Output format:
 * Your output should be a single valid JSON object with the following parts, in the order listed here.
 * `reasoning`: A string describing the reason for the flag boolean. This should cite the instructions that were not
   followed and passages in the FD that diverged from the instructions, or cite the missing content and passages in T
   that were not included in the FD, or cite the extra content and passages in the FD that were not included in T.
 * `score`: An integer value in [0, 1, 2] indicating the quality of the FD.
   0: The FD significantly diverges from the instructions, or significant content presented by H in T is missing from
      the FD, or content in the FD is not present in H's part of the conversation in T.
   1: The FD somewhat diverges from the instructions, or some minor content presented by H in T is missing from the FD,
      or some minor content in the FD is not present in H's part of the conversation in T.
   2: The FD follows the instructions, and all content presented by H in T is included in the FD, and all content in the
      FD is present in H's part of the conversation in T.

## Example outputs:
```
{
  "reasoning": "The FD includes content from the AI assistant that the human user did not explicitly agree with. The included content is [...]",
  "score": 0
}
{
  "reasoning": "The FD omits some significant content that was present in the transcript. The omitted content is [...]",
  "score": 0
}
{
  "reasoning": "The FD has hallucinated content not present in the transcript. The hallucinated content is [...]",
  "score": 0
}
{
  "reasoning": "The FD misses some minor details from the transcript, but otherwise follows the instructions. The missed details are [...]",
  "score": 1
}
{
  "reasoning": "The FD makes some minor inferences or elaborations not present in the transcript, but otherwise follows the instructions. The inferences or elaborations are [...]",
  "score": 1
}
{
  "reasoning": "The FD is complete and follows all instructions.",
  "score": 2
}
```
